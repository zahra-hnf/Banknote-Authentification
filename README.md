# Banknote-Authentification
#The database comes from a machine learning repository "UCI Machine Learning Repository". 
#This data was extracted from exemplary images of genuine and counterfeit banknotes. 
#The digitization of these photos was made with an industrial camera. 
#Thus, the images obtained are 400x400 pixels, a resolution of 660 dpi and in gray levels. 
#Additionally, the wavelet transformation was used to derive features from all of these images.
