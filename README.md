# Banknote-Authentification
This is a Machine learning project about "Banknote Authentification" using Matlab from scratch.
The database comes from a machine learning repository "UCI Machine Learning Repository". 
This data was extracted from exemplary images of genuine and counterfeit banknotes. 
The digitization of these photos was made with an industrial camera. 
Thus, the images obtained are 400x400 pixels, a resolution of 660 dpi and in gray levels. 
Additionally, the wavelet transformation was used to derive features from all of these images.
